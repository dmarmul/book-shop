# About the project

- This project is the first practical experience in writing RESTful applications. 
- It is written entirely in java language, using N-Tier architecture and using MySQL DB.
This practice allowed me to get experience with the Spring Boot framework, as well as learn about the concepts of DTO and mapper. 
- It introduced me to the basic concepts of web application security and the possibility of using JWT token, 
taught me how to use liquibase and Docker and how to write tests for different application layers.
